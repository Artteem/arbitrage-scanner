# Public assets

Upload deployment-specific assets (not stored in Git) before serving the app:

- `/favicon.png`
- `/branding/aytrade-header-light.png`
- `/branding/aytrade-header-dark.png`

These placeholders allow the codebase to reference the correct paths while the actual files
remain outside of version control.
