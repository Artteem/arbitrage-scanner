# Arbitrage Scanner

Monorepo for a crypto arbitrage scanner (backend + frontend).  
Tech stack: **Python 3.11 / FastAPI** (backend), **TypeScript / Next.js** (frontend).

## Structure
- `backend/` — FastAPI service, business logic and integrations.
- `frontend/` — Next.js app (will be added in later steps).
- `docs/` — Architecture, decisions, and runbooks.
- `scripts/` — Utility scripts.
- `.github/workflows/` — CI configs.

## Quickstart
See `docs/02-setup.md` for environment setup and `docs/03-backend-dev.md` to run the API locally.
